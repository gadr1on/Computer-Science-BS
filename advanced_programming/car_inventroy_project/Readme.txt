Description:
	The purpose of this program is to easily sell car related objects in 
	an auto parts business. This program can calculate the total price in 
	real time customer service and the total sales made in the day. 
	In addition, this program can change data from the store’s database to 
	update new information or add new auto parts, or even cars. The program 
	can also check for customer information registered in the store and 
	employee’s information. Basically, this program facilitates auto part 
	vendors to sell their product more efficiently.
